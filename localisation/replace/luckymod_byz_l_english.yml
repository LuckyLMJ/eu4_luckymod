 byz_roman_empire:0 "The Roman Empire"
 byz_roman_empire_desc:0 "We are the true Roman Empire, created as a result of the west-east split and the only surviving remnant. The so-called 'Holy Roman Emperors' are none of those things and the pretenders to our rule in Constantinople are just that - foolish pretenders."
 byz_protect_the_frontiers:0 "Protect the Frontiers"
 byz_protect_the_frontiers_desc:0 "As our empire sees a restoration, so do our frontiers. Let us take an example from the past and properly fortify the border, utilizing the themes as a medium."

 byz_corpus_iuris_civilis_desc:0 "Corpus Iuris Civilis was a codex of laws. Issued by Justinian, it has long been replaced by newer works, but its name could be reutilized as a prestigious title for a brand-new codex."
 
 BYZ_false_despots_title:0 "False Despots"
 BYZ_false_despots_desc:0 "The Despotate of Epirus was established as one of the remnants of the Byzantine Empire following the disaster of 1204. However, it would in time fall under the control of the Neapolitans, further bolstering the Latin influence in Greece. This stronghold must be wiped out!"
 BYZ_magna_graecia_title:0 "Recover Magna Graecia"
 BYZ_magna_graecia_desc:0 "Magna Graecia, the territories settled by Greek Colonies in ancient times, have long been lost to the decline of our Empire. With competent leadership and a powerful navy, it is time to retake those territories and reinstate Roman government in the southern tip of Italy."
 BYZ_carthage_title:0 "Exarchate of Africa"
 BYZ_carthage_desc:0 "The Roman Province of Africa has long been a core territory of the Roman Empire. Upon the Empire's division, it would in no less than a century fall under the rule of the Vandals. It would once again be brought to Roman Lands thanks to Justinian's ambitions. Then it would fall to the Caliphate in 7th century."
 BYZ_impending_doom_title:0 "The Impending Doom"
 BYZ_impending_doom_desc:0 "The Empire is at the brink of destruction. Every Roman citizen is silently aware that the end is nigh, and the days of Roman glory are already numbered. But is there really no hope for the crumbling empire? With the emperors struggling to make alliances with the west and seeking support, there might still be a chance for recovery."
 BYZ_bar_title:0 "Vengeance at Bar"
 BYZ_bar_desc:1 "The disastrous Battle of Bar ensured the Serbian realm was to remain independent from the Byzantine Empire for years to come. While we did manage to strike back at the Serbians since then, they were still able to take over much of our territory and did found the Serbian Empire. Since then, they have succumbed to decline of their own as well. Let us strike them while they are still down!"
 BYZ_illyria_title:0 "Advance into Illyricum"
 BYZ_illyria_desc:0 "The current state of Illyria is a cause for concern. Lately, there has been an increasing amount of interest in the area taken by the Habsburgs, who are trying to exploit the power vacuum in the area and to take ownership of the region."
 BYZ_belisarius_foe_title:0 "Belisarius' Foe"
 BYZ_belisarius_foe_desc:0 "The war against Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy is one of the crowning achievements of Justinian's rule and proof of the military prowess of his general, Belisarius. The struggle against the Ostrogoths proved to be long and exhausting, but it was ultimately successful."
 BYZ_justinians_ambition_title:0 "Justinian's Ambition"
 BYZ_justinians_ambition_desc:0 "The rule of Justinian, one of the most revered Eastern Roman Emperors, was one of glory and success. It is during his rule that the most successful attempt was made at bringing the Roman Empire back to a reality."
 BYZ_iberia_title:0 "Non Plus Ultra"
 BYZ_iberia_desc:0 "To the west lies the strait of Gibraltar, surrounded by the two Pillars of Hercules. The Romans of old believed that beyond Iberia there lies nothing. The sailors of old were warned that there is 'non plus ultra' - nothing further beyond. Today we know there is much west of Iberia that the Spanish have conquered. Let our forces march and claim Hispania with its colonies as rightful Roman territory."
 BYZ_greece_title:0 "Reverse the Downfall"
 BYZ_greece_desc:0 "The Roman Empire has been consistently declining for about a millennium now. With small periods of recovery from time to time, today we may be lying at the definitive end of our journey. With the Ottoman encroaching and lusting for the city of world's desire, the end is looming. While the Ottomans are still occupied, let us strike and bolster our hold in Greece - our most core territory."
 BYZ_bulgaria_title:0 "Reconquer Bulgaria"
 BYZ_bulgaria_desc:0 "While we may have succeeded in retaking Greece from Ottoman hold, the second fight may not be any better. Let us hope the Bulgarian nobles oppose their Muslim overlords more than our rule, exposing themselves to our influence once again."
 BYZ_aegean_islands_title:0 "Repulse the Republics"
 BYZ_aegean_islands_desc:0 "As our state expands and finds itself in a stronger position, the presence of the Latin Republics in our vicinity turns to be more of an impediment than support. It is time to end our lip service to the merchants. The Aegean islands belong to us and our [Root.GetBurghersName]."
 BYZ_venetian_avarice_title:0 "Venetian Avarice"
 BYZ_venetian_avarice_desc:0 "Constantinople fell victim to a siege by the Catholics in 1204. Sacked by Crusaders, who were initially intending to battle Muslims to the east, they would later betray their ideals and turn their attention towards our city and with the support from the treacherous Venetians, the megalopolis would fall to their combined forces in April of that accursed year. The capture would lead to a period of sacking when an innumerable amount of riches and priceless icons were stolen from the Queen of Cities. The Fall of Constantinople led to the establishment of Latin Empire, whose rule was called frankokratia. That period, albeit short, would accelerate the decline and further weaken the empire."
 BYZ_france_title:0 "Beyond the Alps"
 BYZ_france_desc:0 "Beyond the Northern mountains of Italy lie the lands in Gallia, nowadays referred moreso as France, where the descendants of the Gauls and invading Germanic Tribes rule a powerful kingdom. Let us muster the forces from Italy and conquer that kingdom which is suffering from delusions of imperial ambitions."
 BYZ_france_ct:0 "§Y[Root.GetName]§! gains a permanent claim on all provinces in §YBritain§!, §YLow Countries§! and §YWest Germany§! needed for the §YRestore the Roman Empire§! decision."
 BYZ_roman_empire_title:0 "Basileia Rhomaion"
 BYZ_roman_empire_desc:0 "It has been over a millennium since the two Roman Empires were still united. Split in 395, there were hopes that the act would help stop the decline of the Empire and its political system. Instead, the western half would fall in 476 and eastern half would almost fall to the Ottomans in 15th century. Nobody back then would have believed that the heirs of the Eastern monarchs would rule an Empire whole again. The proclamation of the restored Roman Empire is deserving of a great Triumph in Rome itself."
 BYZ_coast_title:0 "Asia Minor"
 BYZ_coast_desc:1 "Though already long conquered and settled by the Ottoman Turks, the western edges of Anatolia are still somewhat core territory of ours. With many Greeks living in the cities and in coastal towns, the reconquest of those territories could prove beneficial to strengthening our maritime commerce and general strength."
 BYZ_avenge_1071_title:0 "Avenge 1071"
 BYZ_avenge_1071_desc:0 "130 years prior to Fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders, the Roman Empire suffered a tragic defeat on the fields of Manzikert, sealing the fate of Roman Anatolia. Following this loss, Anatolia would come to be permanently settled by the Turks, fierce opponents, and rivals to our state. Having driven them out of Greece and Eastern Asia Minor, we should bring an end to their rule in the entirety of Anatolia."
 BYZ_syria_title:0 "Antiochia & Jerusalem"
 BYZ_syria_desc:0 "Syria is home to two of the Pentarchy seats. Settled since ancient times, home to Jesus Christ himself, we must take full control of the province and restore this important region back to the Roman Empire."
 BYZ_egypt_title:0 "Into Aegyptus"
 BYZ_egypt_desc:1 "Holding the Bishopric of Alexandria and the delta of the Nile, Egypt is critical to [Root.GetName] for more reasons than one. To take full control of this province should be our utmost priority and the rule over it is bound to bring us obscene wealth and power. We will unleash its potential and all those before us shall be treated as those who could not wield the true power the region provides."
 BYZ_breadbasket_title:0 "The Breadbasket"
 BYZ_breadbasket_desc:0 "The Nile is the lifeline of the Egyptian civilization. Providing an outstanding supply of irrigation and therefore food, with this great river any civilization can grow in population. Having reconquered the area, let us exploit the Nile to its fullest."
 BYZ_pontic_empire_title:0 "Princes of the Lazes"
 BYZ_pontic_empire_desc:0 "Following the disastrous fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders in 1204, many minor splinters of the Empire have formed. One of them was the Komnenos realm formed in Pontus. Claiming to be the rightful heirs, they are mere pretenders destined to be destroyed. Their rule mostly extends over the Laz people. They are no emperors, but mere princes!"
 BYZ_persians_title:0 "Abase the Persians"
 BYZ_persians_desc:0 "The Roman Empire has a history of centuries full of feuds with the Persians over supremacy in Mesopotamia and Caucasia. Let us move in and deal a decisive blow to their ambitions and pride, forever thwarting their plans for lands west of the Zagros Mountains. They need to be humiliated!"
 BYZ_mesopotamia_title:0 "Follow the Rivers"
 BYZ_mesopotamia_desc:0 "One of the cradles of civilization that is Mesopotamia is surrounded by strong enemies and lacks natural barriers. Let us ensure that it is no other great power's playground but ours. Persians shall have no say in those matters!"
 BYZ_mecca_title:0 "The Heart of Islam"
 BYZ_mecca_desc:0 "Mecca is the center point for the Muslim Community. Home to the first Caliphate that has taken vast swathes of territories from our crumbling empire, it would be most ironic for us to seize their most holy of cities. Even more ironic it would be to convert it to a church."
 BYZ_economic_independence_title:0 "Economic Independence"
 BYZ_economic_independence_desc:0 "After 1204, the successive Emperors tried to make Byzantine markets into an invaluable asset of the Latin merchants, granting them various privileges and excluding them from the kommerkion - 10% customs tax on goods arriving in Constantinople. This had the disastrous effect of destroying our merchants' trust and letting them be outcompeted. Let us reclaim those markets."
 BYZ_return_to_gold_title:0 "Return to Gold"
 BYZ_return_to_gold_desc:0 "In the past, the Eastern Roman Empire would commit to minting gold coins for the subject. However, with loss of gold and silver mines, it would become increasingly difficult to strike such coins. The last gold coin to be struck was hyperperon, and even it would succumb to the usual fate of being debased to support military campaigns."
 BYZ_support_weavers_title:0 "Support the Weavers"
 BYZ_support_weavers_desc:0 "Silk-weaving has a relatively long history in Byzantium. With the smuggling of silkworms in sixth century, the art of sericulture has persisted for a millennium and various guilds of weavers have formed in larger cities. Let us support them and provide them with markets for their goods."
 BYZ_tarnished_state_title:0 "A Tarnished State"
 BYZ_tarnished_state_desc:0 "Our state has become tarnished by war and depopulation. Constant civil wars and conflicts have depleted our most invaluable asset - population. Let our lands be devastated no more and let the vacant homes not be empty any longer."
 BYZ_book_of_the_eparch_title:0 "Book of the Prefect"
 BYZ_book_of_the_eparch_desc:0 "With a growing number of merchants in the Queen of all cities, let us create new manuals and records to keep track of the local burghers. With so many guilds and exceptions, it is imperative the future eparchs have the experience to deal with them."
 BYZ_at_least_10_production_income:0 "At least §Y10.0§!¤ Monthly Income from §YProduction§!."
 BYZ_glass_ware_title:0 "Glass Wares of Byzantium"
 BYZ_glass_ware_desc:0 "The glassmaking of the eastern romans has been nothing short of incredible. Famous across Europe along with the imperial silks, it would influence the Venetian Crystal and give rise to many other styles in the process. But since the Latin merchants have taken over our markets, this art seems to have been lost to time, only remaining significant in Constantinople. Let us rectify that."
 BYZ_city_of_worlds_desire_title:0 "City of World's Desire"
 BYZ_city_of_worlds_desire_desc:0 "Constantinople, the seat of Eastern Roman Empire, bears many names and nicknames. From Byzantium through New Rome, all the way to 'Queen of Cities', the most fitting nickname will always remain to be 'The City of World's Desire', which perfectly exemplifies the envy of the surrounding states."
 BYZ_megalopolis_title:0 "The Megalopolis"
 BYZ_megalopolis_desc:0 "The Byzantine Population was among the most centralized of its time. The inside of Constantinopolitan walls was bustling with life and the city has grown to massive numbers. With the Emperor's court within the city, it was simply economically and politically beneficial to settle in the city. As we restore our Empire, this concentration of wealth is bound to reoccur."
 BYZ_royal_purple_title:0 "The Royal Purple"
 BYZ_royal_purple_desc:0 "Yet the most iconic of all Byzantine symbols has to be the Royal Purple dye. Tyrian Purple garments were the symbol of royalty and royal offspring would be born in a room glazed with purple rock, exceedingly rare at the time. The dye would be produced in several spots across the Empire, but the yields were never high, and availability remained limited. Let us restore the color to the Roman royalty."
 BYZ_promote_the_merchants_title:0 "Promote the [Root.GetBurghersName]"
 BYZ_promote_the_merchants_desc:0 "With our betrayal that we have inflicted upon our [Root.GetBurghersName], the trust between them and the state has become seriously strained. Let us rectify the mistakes of old and give them hope in our rule."
 BYZ_collect_our_profits_title:0 "Collect our Profits"
 BYZ_collect_our_profits_desc:0 "With our support of the merchants and loans provided to the manufacturers, it is high time we collected the interest on them. We reap what we sow, and we are about to feast on the fruits of our labor."
 BYZ_warehouse_of_the_east_title:0 "Warehouse of the East"
 BYZ_warehouse_of_the_east_desc:0 "With our support of manufacturers and the massive growth of cities and guilds, we have risen to a rank of manufacturing Entrepôt. With many prized goods originating right here, the Romans aren't just famous for their long and rich history, but also for the beauty of their fabrics that remains affordable to all."
 BYZ_peloponesian_renaissance_title:0 "Peloponnesian Renaissance"
 BYZ_peloponesian_renaissance_desc:0 "While Constantinople was in imminent danger of an invasion, a fraction of the Byzantine scholars has made Morea their home, giving the peninsula a true rebirth. Originating from Peloponnese was Gemistos Plethon, a philosopher who studied the works of Plato and had deep connections to the old beliefs."
 BYZ_monemvasian_merchants_title:0 "Monemvasian Merchants"
 BYZ_monemvasian_merchants_desc:0 "Monemvasia is a town off the eastern coast of Peloponnese. Situated in a unique position, the site became a local trade center, giving rise to several merchant families, among them the Notaras."
 BYZ_thessaly_title:0 "Trade in Thessaloniki"
 BYZ_thessaly_desc:0 "Thessaloniki would for a long time remain the secondary capital for the empire, fulfilling both political and maritime functions. Let us restore the city to its former glories!"
 BYZ_wealth_from_the_east_title:0 "Wealth from the East"
 BYZ_wealth_from_the_east_desc:0 "As the Empire expands to its old territories, the old trade routes become lively again. We have focused on bringing our core territories to their former selves, but we should do the same to the rest of the former empire! The wealth of the east should once again flow to Constantinople forevermore."
 BYZ_church_in_distress_title:0 "Church in Distress"
 BYZ_church_in_distress_desc:1 "The rightful Church is in distress. Greatly anxious regarding the monarch's decision to enter a union with Rome, the clergy is highly upset, with many priests downright defying the emperor. The faith in the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty must be restored."
 BYZ_muscovite_autocephaly_title:0 "Curb Russian Autocephaly"
 BYZ_muscovite_autocephaly_desc:0 "Following the declaration regarding union of the churches, many bishops in other realms have chosen to sever their ties with us, instead choosing to declare Autocephaly and independence from the patriarch in Constantinople. Among them were the undisputed leaders of this movement in Russia. Let us coerce them to bring them back into the fold."
 BYZ_mend_the_schism_title:0 "Mend the Schism"
 BYZ_mend_the_schism_desc:0 "As a result of conflicts between the Roman supremacy and our rightful belief in equal rights, the supporters of Rome have severed their ties, causing a schism in the church in 1054. With excommunications placed on each other, both churches remain separate to this day. Only our force may rectify that."
 BYZ_church_authority_title:0 "Recover Authority"
 BYZ_church_authority_desc:0 "While we have curbed the anxiety of our priests, the average citizen's belief in the Monarch and Church has plummeted. We need to reassure the population who has been divinely chosen to lead them and this wave of impiety must be stopped."
 BYZ_new_synods_title:0 "New Synods"
 BYZ_new_synods_desc:0 "In the few centuries following Jesus' lifetime, the religious community of bishops has gathered in many Synods to discuss the faith in depth. With the evolution of the world, culture and changes in the socioeconomic sphere, it might be worthwhile to continue this tradition."
 BYZ_pentarchy_title:0 "Restore the Pentarchy"
 BYZ_pentarchy_desc:0 "Before the collapse of our Empire, the five Patriarchs in Antioch, Jerusalem, Alexandria, Rome and Constantinople used to live in relative peace and unity, convening on matters when necessary and serving our ecclesiastical community. Let's bring the golden age back."
 BYZ_reinforce_constantinople_title:0 "Reinforce Constantinople"
 BYZ_reinforce_constantinople_desc:0 "The mighty Theodosian Walls are in disrepair and the Ottoman threat in looming. We need to take action, lest we see our walls crumble like brittle glass."
 BYZ_defence_in_depth_title:0 "Defense in Depth"
 BYZ_defence_in_depth_desc:0 "If we want to hold an impenetrable defense, relying on just one aspect is not going to be enough of an assurance. We need multiple sets of walls and multiple plans in order to be prepared for any knavish trick our foes might have prepared."
 BYZ_hexamilion_title:0 "Hexamilion Wall"
 BYZ_hexamilion_desc:0 "The Hexamilion wall used to protect the isthmus in ancient times. Recently, the wall has been repaired to protect against the Ottomans, but that has failed too. We must either commit or give up on it."
 BYZ_theme_system_title:0 "The Theme System"
 BYZ_theme_system_desc:0 "The Theme System used to be our form of civilian and military governance. Due to the sudden decline in territory, the need for themes has been rendered non-existent. Let us restore this system for good."
 BYZ_restore_navy_title:0 "Restore Byzantine Navy"
 BYZ_restore_navy_desc:0 "The fall of importance of Dromon, supremacy of the Latin Galea, and our dependence on the Latin Republics for naval support has led to our fleet being essentially nought. With our shackles thrown, let us once again arm ourselves on the seas."
 BYZ_greek_fire_title:0 "Sea Fire"
 BYZ_greek_fire_desc:0 "The Greek Fire, known under many names by the Greeks, was among the most important innovations aiding the Eastern Roman Empire. It is the name for a substance that was discharged onto enemy ships and lit on fire, serving as an early flamethrower. This gave the Byzantine navy a significant edge over its maritime rivals, until the practice ceased when the sources of its ingredients were lost."
 BYZ_branching_bottom_title:0 "Branching Mission"
 BYZ_branching_bottom_desc:0 "This is a Branching Mission. Its triggers and effects will be based on our choice in 'The Theme System' mission."

 BYZ_foreign_officers_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Foreign Officers[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_foreign_officers_desc:0 "The general lack of manpower and skilled generals is evident. While not beneficial to the general state of the army, hiring foreign officers and their companies could bolster our reserves and staff."
 BYZ_decentralized_pronoia_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Pronoia Rights[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_decentralized_pronoia_desc:0 "The Pronoiars are mostly hereditary landholders who have been rewarded for their loyal military service. Perhaps the system could see amendments to improve their capabilities, perhaps mimicking the Ottoman Timars."
 BYZ_strategoi_realms_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Realms of the Strategoi[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_strategoi_realms_desc:0 "Through our choices the army has evolved into a decentralized collection of native and foreign generals, holding mostly hereditary tracts of land, where they recruit from the local population and give lands to their most loyal soldiers."
 BYZ_centralized_pronoia_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Control over the Pronoiars[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_centralized_pronoia_desc:0 "Pronoiars are mostly landowners whose land has been granted for military service. Initially non-inheritable, the posts would later become hereditary as being a pronoiar was no longer that special. This institution is of great service to our military, but it does require immediate reform."
 BYZ_reform_the_themata_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]Reform the Themata[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_reform_the_themata_desc:0 "While Theme System functions, it is woefully outdated to modern needs. We need to reform it to better suit the future - an age of gunpowder and standing armies."
 BYZ_varangian_guard_title:1 "[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ]The Varangian Guard[Root.GetPreviewColorBYZ_end]"
 BYZ_varangian_guard_desc:0 "The Varangian Guard was an elite unit within our military. Initially comprised of Viking mercenaries, it would later be reinforced by Anglo-Saxons. The unit would get integrated into the greater society and would cease to exist as a separate regiment. Many were claiming to be Varangians in the 1400s. It is time to restore this famous unit and modernize it."

It cannot be said the city was left unmaintained, but it certainly has not seen the desired growth. As of today, the city once again lies in Roman hands, but the population does not consider themselves Roman.

 MEE_Byzantine_Events.48.d:0 "Since the Eastern and the Western Churches split in 1054, it seemed like there was no unity in sight and there wouldn't be for centuries to come. It almost seemed like the two churches would get reunited in the fifteenth century thanks to the terrible situation the Roman Empire found itself in, but it was able to return to grace, throwing off the shackles of Papal influence. Today, the Empire stands triumphant, having restored the Pentarchy and properly united the two churches, having swayed public opinion towards such outcome."

 MEE_Byzantine_Events.51.d:0 "In 1439, Ioannes travelled to Florence alongside many orthodox religious scholars to discuss the matters of mending the schism with the Pope. With mounting pressure from the Monarch determined to earn support of the Pope and his subordinates, the Byzantines agreed to formally unite the two churches and to accept the superiority of the Pope. This move, while seemingly necessary, would cause the rise of the anti-unionist faction in Constantinople, sparking wide unrest in the last days of the city."
